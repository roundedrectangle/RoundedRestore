# RoundedRestore

## ETA: never

Cross-platform Desktop PureKFD!

Desktop PureKFD is also known as PureRestore

For UI, I'm using Flet (aka Flutter for Python). For internal functionality I use Python. Later I'll use some Swift code from PureKFD-Linux rewritten in Python and some Python code from PureKFD-Linux unmodified.

TODO:

- Picasso repo support
- Install packages
- Add/remove repos
- Package settings

Credits:

- [PureKFDLinux](https://github.com/Lrdsnow/PureKFDLinux) for some code and the idea
